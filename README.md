# GaussianSplat-Contrast-Robotics
This repository contains the full implementation of the GaussianSplat-Contrast pipeline described in my research report. It includes scripts for multi-view or RGB-D capture preprocessing, conversion to 3D Gaussian splatting scenes, per-splat descriptor extraction (geometry + multi-view appearance), contrastive pretraining of the splat embedding encoder, and few-shot fine-tuning for semantic classification and 3D object detection. The repository also holds configuration files, dataset preparation instructions (e.g., for ScanNet and Matterport3D subsets), pretrained model weights, and evaluation scripts for few-shot accuracy, mAP, and inference latency measurements on edge-type GPUs.
